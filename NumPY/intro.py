# lists are slow and numpy are fast 
# faster to read because it uses less bytes of memory
# benefits: SIMD vector processing & effective cache utilization
# applications: mathematics( matlab replacement) & plotting & backend(pandas, connect 4, digital photography) & MACHINE LEARNING

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3])
